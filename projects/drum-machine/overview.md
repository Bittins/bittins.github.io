This is my digitally controlled analog drum machine. It consists of 2 main parts: the sequencer and the modules. The sequencer is powered by an STM32F103 microcontroller, a very available and easily programmable device. I am using the eurorack standard for ease of prototyping. I currently have a kick and snare module complete. These voices are based on the famous Roland TR-808 drum machine circuits, but I have modified them to allow for more customization of the sounds. My original goal was to create a cheap drum machine that would be DIYable for beginners, using only through hole components.
